In computer networks, communication modes define how data is transmitted between devices. 

The three main communication modes are Simplex, Half Duplex, and Full Duplex.

        These terms specifically refer to the mode of communication between two devices or systems.
        1. Simplex:

        - Definition: Simplex communication allows data transmission in only one direction, from the 
                sender to the receiver.There is no capability for the receiver to send data back to 
                the sender.
        - Example: Television broadcast is a common example of simplex communication. TV stations 
                transmit programs to viewers who can only receive the content but cannot send data 
                back to the broadcaster.
        - Usage: Simplex communication is suitable for scenarios where unidirectional transmission 
                is sufficient, such as broadcasting information to multiple recipients or 
                controlling devices remotely.
        
        
        2. Half Duplex:
        - Definition: Half Duplex communication allows data transmission in both directions, but not 
                simultaneously.Devices can either transmit or receive data at any given time, but 
                not both simultaneously.
        - Example: Walkie-talkies are an example of half duplex communication. Users must press a 
                button to transmit their message and release it to listen to the response, enabling 
                alternating transmit and receive operations over the same channel.
        - Usage: Half duplex communication is suitable for scenarios where simultaneous transmission 
                in both directions is not required, such as two-way radio communication or Ethernet 
                networks with collision detection.

        
        3. Full Duplex:
        - Definition: Full Duplex communication allows data transmission in both directions 
                simultaneously. Devices can transmit and receive data concurrently, maximizing 
                bandwidth utilization and minimizing latency.
        - Example: Telephone conversations exemplify full duplex communication. Both parties can speak and 
                listen simultaneously, enabling smooth and uninterrupted communication.
        - Usage: Full duplex communication is suitable for scenarios where real-time bidirectional 
                communication is necessary, such as telephony, video conferencing, and Ethernet networks 
                without collision detection.



        These terms describe techniques for data retrieval or client-server communication patterns 
                rather than the underlying communication channel mode.
