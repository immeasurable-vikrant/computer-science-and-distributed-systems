Networking:

- What is a Network?
        A network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, and other hardware, 
        that communicate with each other to share resources and data.

- What is Networking?
        Networking refers to the practice of connecting and managing these devices to enable communication, 
        data exchange, and resource sharing between them.

- What is Computer Networking?
        Computer networking is the specific practice of connecting computers and related devices using 
        wired or wireless methods to facilitate communication and resource sharing. It involves both 
        hardware (e.g., routers, switches) and software (e.g., protocols, network management tools).

- Why Do We Need Computer Networking?
        - Resource Sharing: Allows sharing of hardware (printers, scanners) and software resources (files, applications).
        - Communication: Facilitates communication through emails, messaging, and video conferencing.
        - Data Transfer: Enables efficient and quick transfer of data between devices.
        - Centralized Management: Allows for centralized administration and management of devices and data.
        - Scalability and Flexibility: Supports the growth and adaptation of systems to meet evolving needs.

When Did Computer Networking Happen?
        Early Development: Computer networking began in the 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, 
                a project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
                The goal was to create a decentralized communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack. 
                ARPANET laid the foundation for the modern internet.
                
        Commercial Adoption: In the 1980s and 1990s, computer networking expanded rapidly with the rise of personal 
                computers and the commercialization of the internet. Companies and individuals began connecting to the 
                internet, leading to the establishment of the World Wide Web and the proliferation of online services.


How Does Computer Networking Work?

        - Physical Layer: Involves the actual hardware connections using cables (Ethernet) or wireless signals (Wi-Fi).
        - Data Link Layer: Manages the node-to-node data transfer (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
        - Network Layer: Handles data routing and addressing (IP addresses).
        - Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP) or faster, less reliable transfer (UDP).
        - Application Layer: Interfaces directly with the end-user applications (HTTP, FTP).      

These layers work together to allow devices to communicate, share resources, and transfer data efficiently across networks.`
